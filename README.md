# School Management System

A simple, modular command-line system for managing students, subjects, and grades. This project is being developed as part of my learning journey in Python, with a focus on clean architecture, modularization, and best practices in software development.

## 📚 About the Project

This system allows basic management of academic records, including:

- Student registration with unique IDs
- Subject (discipline) registration
- Assignment of subjects to students
- Record of grades per student and subject
- File-based storage using JSON

The system is currently under development and evolving step by step, with progressive refactoring and feature expansion.

Each package is designed to encapsulate responsibilities, making the project more readable and maintainable.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.11+
- Standard library only (`os`, `json`, etc.)
- Modular programming
- CLI-based interaction (no GUI yet)

## 🎯 Objectives

- Practice Python fundamentals through a real-world simulation
- Apply best practices in organizing code (modularization, separation of concerns)
- Prepare the project to be extended (e.g. test suite, database, user interface)
- Use this project as part of my future portfolio

## 📌 Status

This is a work in progress (WIP). The project is functional in its initial stage and is being continuously improved as I advance in my studies.

## 🗂️ Future Plans

- Add automated tests (pytest)
- Implement error handling and validation
- Refactor for user input flow improvements
- Add support for removing or updating students/subjects
- Optionally, integrate a GUI or database in future versions

## 📄 License

This project is open for educational purposes and does not have a formal license yet.
